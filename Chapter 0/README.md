# Why RUST ðŸ¦€

1. Rust is safe, reliable and fast.
2. Rust has an amazing toolchain, thus making your developer experience the best that it can be.
3. Rust has high level abstractions with low level accessibility.
4. Rust is a beautiful language capable of handling low level systems programming to higher level tasks like building a web server, a cli tool or even a webapp.

## The RUST way
Rust is introduced in the [RUST BOOK](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/foreword.html) with the following:
***"It wasnâ€™t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before."***

The guiding principle behind rust is to help you reach for goals that you previously considered impossible with just one programming langauge. Rust is clearly a language **of the engineers, by the engineers, for the engineers**.
The way the language has been designed, taking its lessons from its predecessors while keeping in mind a future that is boundless in its possibilites. Rust is all about breaking barriers and the desire for efficiency that is at the core of all engineering. 

### Final notes
This is my take on the classic rust book that has been the standard for learning all that you need to know about rust to get started and dive into the rabbit hole.
I am just beginning on my journey to become a rustacean, so forgive me for any inaccuracies that might occur in my interpretation. I hope to learn a lot and for anyone reading this, I hope my work brings value to your own journey to learning rust.
